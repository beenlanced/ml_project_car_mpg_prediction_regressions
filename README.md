# Linear Regression, Multiple Regressions, and Quantile Regression Explanation

This repository contains code examples, image files, IJulia notebooks and other general materials related to explaining Linear Regressions, Multiple Regressions, and the benefits
of Quantile Regression.<br>

Good luck and hope the material can be of instructional use. <br>


## Getting Started

Nothing really fancy here to mention. Just pull files as needed and run the code or
peruse the material for information purposes. <br>


### Prerequisites

You will only need access to a machines running at least Julia version 1.4.0, If you are using JuliaPro use will need the DifferentialEquations, Plots, and DataFrames packages and code will be setup for you. Checkout Installing section below <br>


### Installing

Please go [here](https://julialang.org/downloads) for information on downloading Julia code <br>


## Deployment

No deployment required either!

## Files and other code were built with and using:

* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - Text editor jazzed up with Juno to run Julia
* [Julia](https://julialang.org) - Julia, the high performance dynamic programming language
* [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) - Jupyter Notebook for Julia 
* **AND LOVE :-P**

## Contributing

No real contributions from you are required. Please use this as needed

## Versioning

We use [Git](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
